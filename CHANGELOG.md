# v0.14.4

- Some additional debugging settings have been added to help track down analysis server issues
- Changing analysis server debug settings will now prompt you to reload the project to restart the analysis server
- Some minor tweaks have been made to the error report generation when the analysis service crashes
- Exception analytics should no longer sometimes include users source code paths/filenames in logs

# v0.14.3

- When changing the `dart.sdkPath` setting you will now be prompted (and given a button) to reload the project
- If the analysis service crashes and analytics are enabled, the first line of the error message will be included in an analytics event 

# v0.14.2

- Fix to fix for analytics :(

# v0.14.1

- Minor update to improve session handling for analytics

Note: Due to use of new APIs, Dart Code v0.14 requires Visual Studio Code v1.6 or newer.

## Debug Just My Code

New options have been added controlling whether to step into SDK and external library code when debugging. When first opening Dart Code with this change you will be prompted to choose whether to "Debug just my code" or "Debug all code". You can change this at any time with the `dart.debugSdkLibraries` and `dart.debugExternalLibraries` options.

## Analysis Server Error Reporting

If the analysis server encounters an error you will now be prompted (up to 3 times per session) to report the issue to the Dart team. Clicking "Generate error report" will build a document of markdown that you can simple copy/paste directly into the Dart SDK issue tracker (linked at the top of the report).

## Misc

- A small change was made to ensure [debugging compatibility with future versions of the Dart SDK](https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!msg/announce/VxSw-V5tx8k/wPV0GfX7BwAJ).
- If the Dart SDK is not found on your machine, the error message will now include a button to launch the [Dart installation page](https://www.dartlang.org/install).

- Completion for methods/constructors now adds placeholders for mandatory arguments
- Completion for named arguments now adds a placeholder for the value
- Pressing `<ENTER>` in a triple-slash comment (`/// ...`)  will now pre-complete the comment markers for the next line
- Pressing `<ENTER>` in an old-style multiline comment (`/** ... */`) will now pre-complete following lines and place the closing marker (`*/`) in the right position
- Hovers will no longer contain hyperlinks that don't work when docs reference other elements
- Display improvements to hovers/tooltips (these are not finished and will continue to be improvedin future releases)
- Completion now shows when an element is `deprecated`

Additionally there were some performance improvements, the beginning of automated testing and some additional diagnostic settings (to help users provide more detailed information if they encounter bugs).

Many bugs have been fixed by Microsoft and the Dart team that affect Dart Code so please be sure to upgrade to the latest versions of Code (`1.5`) and the Dart SDK (`1.19.1`).
